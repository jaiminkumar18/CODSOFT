# Project Title:

### "Titanic Survival Rate Prediction"
### "IMDb Indian Movies Rating Prediction"
### "Classification of IRIS Flower"
### "Coming soon..."

# Description:

### PROJECT 1: "Predicted the survival rate of Titanic passengers based on various features using machine learning techniques."
### PROJECT 2: "Developed a model to predict IMDb ratings for Indian movies, exploring key factors influencing ratings."
### PROJECT 3: "The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 100% on the test set, showcasing its ability to distinguish between different iris species based on their features. I also visualized decision boundaries and feature importances for better interpretability."
### PROJECT 4: "Coming soon..."

# Technologies Used:

### PROJECT 1: "Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn,ML-Algorithm"
### PROJECT 2: "Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn,ML-Algorithm"
### PROJECT 3: "Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn,matplotlib,ML-Algorithm"

# Results:

### PROJECT 1: "Achieved an accuracy of 82% in predicting Titanic survival rates using a Random Forest classifier."
### PROJECT 2: "Developed a regression model with an R-squared of 0.88 for predicting IMDb ratings of Indian movies."
### PROJECT 3: "Developed a classification model with an R-squared of 1.0(100%) for predicting the Class of IRIS FLOWER."
